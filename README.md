This project develops a linear regression model to predict startup profits based on investment and operational expenses. The dataset includes:

R&D Spend: Investment in research and development.
Administration: Administrative expenses.
Marketing Spend: Budget allocated to marketing.
State: Location of the startup.
Profit: The target variable representing company earnings.
Approach
Preprocessing: Handle missing values and encode categorical data (State).
EDA: Analyze correlations between investments and profit.
Model Training: Train a regression model to predict profit using spending data.
Evaluation: Assess performance with RMSE and RÂ² metrics.
This model helps startups estimate potential profits based on investment decisions.
